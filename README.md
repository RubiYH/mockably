# Mockably (PoC)

## 🚀 Realtime Backend Implementation on Frontend

Mockably is a frontend-first backend implementation that allows you to build realtime applications without caring about the backend server at all.

### Features I'm testing on

- ✅ SQL-like CRUD operations by leveraging [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) web API
- ✅ Offline support
- ⌛️ Online support (Realtime P2P syncing)
- and so on...
